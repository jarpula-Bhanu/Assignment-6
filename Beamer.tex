\section{Question}
\begin{frame}{Problem}
Q)A doctor is to visit patient. Form the past experience, it is known that the probabilities that he will come by train, bus, scooter or by other means of transport are respectively $\frac{3}{10}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{1}{10}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ . The probabilities that he will be late are $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{12}$, if he comes by train, bus and scooter respectively, but if he comes by other means of trasnsport, then he will not be late. When he arrives,he is late. What is the probability that he comes by the train?
\end{frame}

\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution}
 Let $E$ be the event that the doctor visits the patient late and let $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$ and $T_4$ be the events that the doctor comes by train, bus, scooter and other means of transport respectively. \\
Then, probability that doctor chooses particular mode of transport
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability of choosing train $\implies$ $Pr(T_1) = \frac{3}{10}$ 
    \item Probability of choosing bus $\implies$ $Pr(T_2) = \frac{1}{5}$
    \item Probability of choosing scooter $\implies$ $Pr(T_3) = \frac{1}{10}$ 
    \item Probability of choosing other means $\implies$ $Pr(T_4) = \frac{2}{5}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Probability that doctor late by that particular mode of transport
\begin{itemize}
	\item Probability of being late by train $\implies$ $Pr(E|T_1) = \frac{1}{4}$
	\item Probability of being late by bus $\implies$ $Pr(E|T_2) = \frac{1}{3}$ 
	\item Probability of being late by scooter $\implies$ $Pr(E|T_3) = \frac{1}{12}$
	\item Probability of being late by other means $\implies$ $Pr(E|T_4) = 0$ \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
$\therefore$ by Baye's Theorem, we have \\
$Pr(T_1|E)$ = Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train 

\begin{align}
Pr(T_1|E)& = \frac{Pr(T_1)Pr(E|T_1)}{\sum_{i=0}^4 Pr(T_i)Pr(E|T_i)} \\
Pr(T_1|E) &= \frac{\frac{3}{10}\times \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{10}\times \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{12}+\frac{2}{5}\times 0} \\
&= \frac{3}{40}\times \frac{120}{18} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align} 
Hence, the required probability is $\frac{1}{2}$
